It is in [Allan Grinshtein’s](https://dribbble.com/Allan) work that I've found not only the sweet smell of the sea, but [sumptuous waves](https://dribbble.com/shots/1764344-HelpCreature-Welcome-Email), even if these ones seem to fall from the sky.

Let’s stop the divagation here, having no tangible evidence maybe the waves are in fact trees ?
